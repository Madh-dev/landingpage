# Snap Event Landing Page

A responsive React component that conditionally renders a "Create my event" button based on the screen size.

## How It Works
The component uses React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage the showButton state and update it based on the screen size. The handleResize function is called initially to set the initial state, and a resize event listener is added to update the state when the screen size changes. The button is conditionally rendered based on the showButton state.
